1. How to use the programme

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
Open your terminal or some other environment for running Python 3.
For example, in your terminal, enter "python3 mondriangenerator.py".

It will then tell you to enter a grid size. For example, for a 3x3 grid diagram, enter "3".

Next it'll tell you to enter the grid. The entry is line-by-line. For example, enter "1 1 0". Then enter "1 0 1". Finally enter "0 1 1". Here the 1s represent marked squares on the grid diagram, and 0s represent unmarked squares.

If you entered a valid grid diagram, it'll take several seconds to generate a Mondrian artwork of the grid diagram and then quit the programme. Otherwise it'll quit the programme without doing anything. Note that the artwork will be shown, and it'll also be saved (as image.py) in the same directory as the programme file.

2. Shoutout to my friends

Thanks Talia Blum, David Farrell, Peter Huxford and Yustyna Klish for helping with some planning and generally listening to my frequent updates as I wrote the code. 

3. Coding disclaimer

If you're good at coding, you probably want to avoid looking at what I wrote because it's definitely very inefficient and it'll probably hurt you.
